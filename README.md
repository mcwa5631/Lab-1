## My favourite thing I have written

Hi. My name is Jack McWatt. My favourite thing that I have written is my resume. It is a reflection of all my past work experience and achievements I am most proud of.

It is an ongoing project and can be difficult to frame my past experiences in a way that would be accepted by an employer, however it is a good challenge that I constantly face.
